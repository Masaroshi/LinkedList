As a Linked List I should be able to:
    + Create a new node:
        - at the beginning
        - at the end
        - at a specific position
    + Delete a node:
        - from the beginning
        - from the end
        - with a specific value
        - from a particular position
    + Determine my length
    + Convert to a Circular Linked List
    + Convert to a Double Linked list
    + Display my data
    + Count the number of times a data occurs
    + Check if a linked list is Circular or not
    + Check if a linked list is Double or not
    + Exchanging nodes:
        - first and last
        - chosen nodes
